# KimiVanish
A 1.13 to 1.19 all-in-one open source vanish plugin solution for Minecraft.

## **Why KimiVanish?**
- **Easy to use** - With a mostly permission-based system, it's very quick and easy for you to grant users specific permissions to commands, subcommands and features. Alongside this, using this plugin as a dependency offers you the ability to listen to vanish-related events easily.
- **Infinite levels of vanish** - You can have as many levels to your vanish system as you like. Let's say you have 10 different staff roles, or 10 different individuals you wish to grant permissions to vanish; well, simply give them the permission `kimivanish.level.x` and you're all set.
- **Configurable** - You can choose to toggle certain features in the config.yml, you can do this by editing the boolean (true or false).
- **Easy access to support** - You can contact me directly via Discord or Spigot direct messages and you should receive a reply within hours, or if I'm online, minutes. 
- **Integration with other plugins** - Optionally, you can use EssentialsX and PlaceholderAPI with KimiVanish for a better experience with player hiding and placeholders.
- **Player preferences** - Unlike some other plugins, vanished players have control over what settings they'd like to use whilst in vanish. Don't want to be teleported back to your vanish position? Simply toggle it off with one command.
- **Free** - Lastly, KimiVanish is free and open source. Can't argue with free, right?
